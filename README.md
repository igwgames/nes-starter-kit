## What is this?

It's a fully-fledged starter kit for NES games. It is the source to a top-down adventure game, alongside all of the 
tools needed to change it. It also comes with a guide to changing everything about it, which could also be titled
"The dummy's guide to creating an NES game".

The idea is, copy this code using `create-nes-game`, run the game, then tweak it and make
your own! With the right hardware, you can even play your game on your own NES.

The only thing this is *not* is an introduction to programming - if you have never programmed anything before, I
suggest finding a tutorial online for C or C++, and getting a couple really basic programs working. (At the
very least, find out what a "hello world" program is, and write+run one successfully.) 

One options is the [Learn C Tutorial](http://www.learn-c.org/) - it lets you write and run your code in the 
browser, so you don't need to set anything up! 

## 2.0 BREAKING CHANGE

Version 2.0 is a major update to `nes-starter-kit`. The entire build process has been replaced. This
should make starting new projects significantly easier, but the new build process makes it very hard to upgrade
existing projects. The original tools will continue to be supported indefinitely. You can use tag `v1.0.8` 
or the `master` branch.

If you are interested in converting to 2.0, please reach out! It's possible, but the way to do it isn't
straightforward, and will likely require a bit of collaboration. 

## What's new in 2.0?

Version 2.0 brings a number of long-needed changes, including greatly simplifying getting started.
 Here's a summary of major changes:

- Build moved away from cygwin and makefiles to [create-nes-game](https://cppchriscpp.github.io/create-nes-game) - a one-stop-shop for building NES games
- Official linux support for build tools (including x86 and arm64! Wanna build on a newer raspberry pi?)
- New games can be created automatically from create-nes-game's interactive guide
- Full support for debugging in Mesen, with source code in both C and assembly language
- Collision bug with doors finally fixed! They're now solid, and you won't get stuck in them. 

If you tried to set this up before and got impatient, now is a good time to give it another try!

# Table of Contents

This guide is broken into 4 main chapters: 

1. Getting Started
2. Making it Your Own
3. Adding new features
4. Adding Polish
5. Advanced topics.

The suggested approach is to follow along with all of part 1 in order to get yourself familiar with
the console/tools/etc. After that, feel free to jump around to whatever chapters interest you. 

The second part mainly focuses on core things you will want to change to make your own game. Art, music
gameplay and more!

The third part focuses on how you can extend the game further. Want to give the main character a weapon?
Add some new features to the start menu? Do something else unique? This has guides and pointers on how to
do it!

The fourth part focuses on more cosmetic things - don't be afraid to get into these chapters early; 
sometimes adding a little bit of polish can really help encourage you to continue working on the game.

The final part deals with more advanced topics - for most simple games, you won't need to read 
anything in this section. It gets into depth on details of how the library itself works, as well as the 
system, and how the rom is organized. That said, these topics are here if you need them, or for that 
matter if they interest you.

## Related projects

There are a few other projects worth knowing about that might be a better fit for your task.

First off, there's the upcoming NESMaker project. This has not yet been released, but it is a full-blown
gui for building games. Check out the [NESMaker website](http://www.thenew8bitheroes.com/)! This project is 
a good fit if you don't quite want to get your hands dirty with code. You may be able to edit the resulting
code, but it will likely be in assembly language, and a little harder to pick up if that is new to you.

If coding really isn't your thing and you like puzzle games, I have a puzzle game maker available: 
[Retro Puzzle Maker](https://puzzle.nes.science). It's very user-friendly, and it
can actually be extended with many of the same tools if you want to.

Another option, the Mojon Twins' MK1_NES modular game engine can be found here:
[MK1-NES](https://github.com/mojontwins/MK1_NES).

Lastly, if you want something more barebones, I also have nes-c-bootstrap - it is a simpler "Hello World"
project that you can use for more of a blank page. That project is elsewhere 
[on Github](https://github.com/cppchriscpp/nes-c-boilerplate).

Be aware that nes-c-bootstrap has not seen regular maintenance, and may be out of date.
