# Playing your Game

![Play Time!](../images/playing_your_game.png)

Okay, so you've set up your tools, you've built the game, and you've started it in the emulator. How do you play it?

The controls are pretty straightforward. 
- `Start` will start the game, as well as pause.
- The `Directional pad` is used to select things in menus, and also move in-game.
- The `A` button is currently unused
- The `B` button is currently unused

To start the game, you can either run the `create-nes-game run` command, or double-click the `.nes` file in the `rom/` folder
after building the game.
