# Things to know about the NES and C

Okay, so you've (hopefully) programmed in C, or some other C-like language before. 
(If that statement isn't true, don't be too scared! There is a really good C tutorial
linked from the main readme file; go try that out and come back once you feel more
comfortable.) There are a few details about the console that will help you along,
as well as a few C language features you won't see often elsewhere. 

This may not all make sense right away; that's fine! Just be sure to come back here
when you encounter some of these things, and read up as needed.

## On bytes, bits, and Hexidecimal numbers

On the NES (and most computers), everything is stored in one or more things called
bytes. A byte is a number between 0 and 255, and can represent anything from a health
value, to a single letter in a name. A `char` (or `unsigned char`) takes up this
much space. Larger things (like `int`s) are made up of multiple bytes.

The numbers between 0 and 255 are typically represented by numbers between 0 and
9, put together to form bigger numbers. You count them like this:
```
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 
```

Hexidecimal is another way to represent those numbers, that is closer to how a 
computer uses them.  A number of our tools use this format, and we also use 
it in the code quite often as a result. In hexidecimal, rather than a digit being 
from 0-9, digits go from 0-f. Each digit can be one of sixteen values, and represents 
half a byte. In C, hexidecimal numbers are prefixed with `0x`. (For example, 
`0x10` in hexidecimal is `16` in regular base-10 digits.)

Counting the same numbers (0-20, or 0x00 to 0x14) in hexidecimal looks like this: 

```
0x00 0x01 0x02 0x03 0x04 0x05 0x06 0x07 0x08 0x09 0x0a 0x0b 0x0c 0x0d 0x0e 0x0f 0x10
0x11 0x12 0x13 0x14
```

You can also represent larger numbers in hexidecimal. For example, the integer value
of 256 can be represented as `0x100` and 1024 can be repesented as `0x400`.


Why do we care about these numbers, though? The answer is faster code, and also a better
understanding of the underlying system. To survive writing code for the NES, you will have
to have a basic understanding of this. Every number we store actually stored as a pattern of
bits. A bit is a single point of data - it can be set to `0` or `1`. 

A byte like we described above is actually 8 bits put together. Understanding this lets you
do magic tricks with numbers to make math much faster and easier. 

Follow [this tutorial](http://www.purplemath.com/modules/numbbase.htm) if you haven't encountered
binary numbers before. Think about how you could change the binary numbers if you shifted all 
of the binary digits over by one. This will be useful in a few moments.

## A quick introduction to bitwise operators

Now that we know how numbers are stored, we can start to think about how we can manipulate them
quickly. For starters, think about how you might divide a number by hand. For example, let's divide
12 by 4. Traditionally, you might do this: 

```c
unsigned char bigNumber = 12;
unsigned char result = bigNumber / 4; // This will contain 3
```

After this runs, `result` will contain `3` as you expect. Behind the scenes though, the console
might take `12` and subtract `4` 3 times to figure that out. (Note: Technically, the compiler will optimize 
this correctly so you do not have to in this simple case. It is not safe to rely on that though! This isn't 
as nice as the compilers you have for most modern systems.)

What if we could do this more quickly? Think about how these numbers are laid out in binary: 
12 is actually equal to `0x0b` in hex, or `00001100` in binary. Each digit in the binary is a power of two, 
so if we simply shift the number over one digit, we get `00000110`, or 6. If we do the same thing again,
we get `00000011`, which is equal to `3`! This only took two operations. This is called a bit shift, and C
makes them really easy! Here's the same code again, but with shifting: 

```c
unsigned char bigNumber = 12;
unsigned char result = bigNumber >> 2; // This will contain 3.
```

This is admittedly a little hard to read, but can help save cycles. You won't have to do this with all
of your code, but if you are having problems with speed or space this will definitely help. Plus, the engine
uses this kind of thing all over the place, so it is best to understand them.

**This is only one of many tricks - check out [this tutorial](https://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/bitwise_operators.html) for a much better explanation!**

## There is *very* little RAM available

The NES has 2kb of ram available to it - period. That is not a typo; you can store
at most 2048 unique one byte values in ram at once. (Technically there are ways to 
expand this with special NES cartridges; this is covered in an advanced chapter about SRAM.)

This results in us using some amount of trickery for storage - such as packing multiple
small values into a single byte, and using the `unsigned char` type everywhere. (It takes
up 1 byte. The `int` type takes up 2.) Note that constant (`const`) variables do not count
towards this total.

## The zero page is a small amount of "special" ram

The NES has 256 bytes that can be accessed a little faster than the rest. This is called
the "zero page" - you will see us define a number of variables with `ZEROPAGE_VAR` - this
will create that variable in this space. This should be used for your most frequently-
accessed variables. The engine uses a lot of this space already, so choose carefully.

## There is limited program space too

The NES has a very limited amount of space for your code - 32 kilobytes of code and data
is visible at a time. Games can be bigger than this (the default rom in this engine 
reserves 128 kilobytes of space) but we have to do some tricks to make this work. 

We do this by separating the code into multiple banks - these are 16 kilobyte sections
of code. The NES can have two of these banks loaded at once. The first 16 kilobyte bank
is always loaded (It is sometimes called the `kernel`, or the fixed bank) - we put all 
of our most heavily used code in this. 

There is also a second slot for a bank- this one can have any one of the other 7 
banks loaded into it. We put most of our code (and other data, such as maps) into one 
of the other 7 banks, then call the function in a special way that knows how to access 
the correct bank.

To set which bank to put code into, we use the `CODE_BANK()` macro, with a number
placed into it. If this is used at the top of a code file, all code winds up in that
bank. To call code in a bank, we use the `banked_call()` method. There are a lot of
examples of this in `source/main.c`.

## How to work within these system's limitations

As the past couple headings demonstrated, the NES is _very_ limited as a console. 

As a result, you will also need to do some things that otherwise might be bad C 
practice, just to keep your game playable. 

Here are some examples: 
- Use global variables wherever possible
- Reuse the same variable for multiple things (Use `#define` to make things more readable)
- Avoid using function parameters if a global variable could suffice
- Prefer separate arrays of bytes instead of arrays of structs
- Always use the `const` keyword when defining constant data
- Prefer using `++i` over `i++` - the resulting code is smaller and faster
- Be familiar with bitwise operators (such as `<<`, `>>`, `&` and `|`) and use them often
- Use bit shifting (`<<` and `>>`) in place of multiplication and division whenever possible

If you are familiar with assembly, or think you can figure it out, every `.c` file is compiled
down to a `.s` assembly file in the `temp/` directory during each build. The file is laid out
such that each line of C is entered as a comment, then all assembly code for that line is
included after. You can tweak your code and see what produces less instructions this way, if
you are so inclined.

## How to debug/print log statements

The NES is a bit hard to work with due to its limitations, so this is tough. The browser or IDE you are reading 
this in likely used more RAM to display it than the NES has. There aren't a lot of tools targetting the NES, 
either, so debugging is pretty difficult compared to modern systems. 

There is no `cout` or `console.log` here, so what can we do?

The closest thing we have is a method called `crash_error()` which is included by `source/menus/error.h`. It will
crash the entire game, and print out any text you want alongside an optional variable. If you add this to your game,
you can see what was set at a certain time - it's not much, but hopefully it helps. 

Here's an example: 

```c
crash_error("Got Here", "You got to this point in the code", NULL, NULL);
```

You can inject this in various places to see where you get to. You can also provide a variable as needed, like this:

```c
crash_error("Crashed Bandicoot", "Got to the point in code where we use gameState", "GameState Value", gameState);
```

![blue screen of death](../images/bluescreened.png)

This error screen can help in situations where the game is acting strangly, and other tools are not helping enough.

Emulators also have debuggers for the NES, and using this project you'll actually be able to see your C and assembly
code directly in the emulator. Use this to your advantage!

## Feeling overwhelmed?

Don't stress out if a lot of this doesn't make sense yet - really, it's ok. Just
start exploring the other chapters and start tweaking the game, then come back
here when you hit something strange. Try to keep the high-level details in mind,
so you know when to look back. 

The next chapter is a frequently asked questions guide. Skimming the question
titles is probably a good idea, since there is a decent chance you will have
one of those questions at some point soon. 

Beyond that, skip on to section 2, and start building your game!
