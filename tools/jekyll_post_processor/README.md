# Jekyll Post Processor

This is a kinda-quick-and-dirty shell script that manipulates our markdown to prepare it for use as a 
Jekyll site. There are probably better ways to do what this does, but this works. 

There are some comments in-line - I will leave it to those to explain exactly what is going on. 

There are also a few other files in this directory - they are deployed into various places in the 
jekyll build. They are files that are specific to our documentation. Everything else is committed
onto the `gh-pages` branch, which is deployed to https://nes-starter-kit.nes.science
