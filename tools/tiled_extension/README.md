# Tiled Plugin

This is a little helper plugin for Tiled that will show you warnings if you put tiles onto the sprite
layer, or sprites onto the tile layer. It also allows you to automatically correct them with a keyboard
shortcut.

**It is currently quite broken, and not suggested for use!**

The short version of setup is to drop the `nes-starter-kit-tiled` folder into your Tiled extensions folder. 

More information and setup details in the [Changing the World](../../guide/section_2/changing_the_world.md) chapter.
