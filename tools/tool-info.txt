NES-STARTER-KIT TOOLS
---------------------

This zip file contains tools for working with NES games that nes-starter-kit integrates well with.
Each of these tools has its own license, which is documented in the author-provided readme files
that come in the tools/tool_name folder. Please be sure to read these! 

If your tool is in this zip and you would prefer people be asked to dowload it manually, please
reach out. The goal is to simplify environment setup, and as far as I could tell all licenses allow
for binary distributions as long as the license is included. That said, if you have a reason you
would prefer your program not be shipped this way, I'm happy to listen!

These tools are not stored in git, as it is generally a bad idea to put 
large/binary files into git repositories - it slows the entire repository down, and makes
it harder to access. Apologies for the complicated setup, but I promise it exists for a reason!
